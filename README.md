=======

An example repo. Fork away, commit, send pull requests, and just get used to using git!


Instructions
------------
First, fork this repo with the Fork button at the top. This will create a repo
that you own under your name. From now on, "this repo" refers to your forked
repo.

# If you're using GitHub for Windows:
1. Make sure that your credentials are set up. If you are logged in using your
   GitHub account, the defaults should be good, but they don't take effect until
   you look at them. Click the settings button, then click update.

2. Clone (download) this repo. Click on your username in the sidebar, then click
   "Clone" beside the repo you want to clone (which is obviously this one, or
   you wouldn't be reading this).

3. Find the repo in your local file system. GitHub will default to My
   Documents\GitHub.

4. Change testFile.txt in any text editor. It's just a normal file, and GitHub
   doesn't care how you edit it.

5. Go back to your GitHub window. Click on "Local" in the sidebar and
   double-click on the repo.

6. There should be a dropdown at the top left next to "Uncommitted Changes."
   Click it.

7. You should now see a log of your changes on the right side of the screen.
   Make sure these are the changes that you want to make, then type a message to
   go in the history in the dropdown. The summary is necessary, but the longer
   description is not. When you're done with your message, click "Commit."

8. Now that you've made changes to your repo, you'll want to request it to be
   pulled into the main repo. On the GitHub website, find your repo. Click the
   green button to submit a pull request. Give a reason why, then click "Create
   Pull Request."

9. You now know the very basics of using GitHub to collaborate! Have fun!
